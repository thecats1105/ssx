## **FEATURES**

<br/>

### - üõ∏ **'Outta This World' speed**

<br/>

**Scoop Super Search** is capable of searching in more than 800 buckets and 52,000 app manifests in internet. It uses the lightning fast [ScoopMaster database](https://github.com/letscoop/ScoopMaster) to provide intantaneous results in less than 500 ms.

<br/>

### - ‚≠ê **Always updated**
<br/>

**Scoop Super Search** uses the [ScoopMaster database](https://github.com/letscoop/ScoopMaster), ensuring the latest results and highest versions for every app in Scoop. The database is updated every 30 minutes, ensuring fresh results, newer than even the official scoop app database.

<br/>

### - üîç **Searches in names AND descriptions improving the search flexibility.**
<br/>

Most Scoop search tools provide results only referred to the app name. SSx can search also in the app descriptions.

<br/>

### - üîç&üîç **Match All keywords capability.** 
<br/>

Most Scoop search systems provide results for a single keyword. SSx can search combinations of OR and AND.

<br/>

### - üîß **Complex REGEX search patterns for advanced users**
<br/>

**SSx** also supports extended **REGEX** pattern seaches, accepting even multiple regex patterns.

<br/>

### - **(Èü≥‰πê) UTF-8 compatible**
<br/>

**SSx** accepts searches in UTF-8 encoding, supporting searches in descriptions when the language uses suplemental Unicode pages. Please note that this feature requires a UTF-8 capable terminal such as Windows Terminal.

<br/>

### - üïí **Last-manifest filter**
<br/>

Typical search utilities provide only the list of matches including all the versions and all the manifests for that app. **SSx** can also filter out all the noise in the report, displaying only the latests manifest of the highest version of each app.

<br/>

### - üé® **Color coding for quick reference**
<br/>

The result is displated with color coding for easy identigication of the matched words, the official buckets, and the bucket of the newer manifest available for each app.

<br/>

### - ü™ü **Interoperability with other PowerShell scripts**
<br/>

**SSx** can provide the output as a PSObject format so other PowerShell utilities could use the data for other tasks.

<br/>

### - üåê **Homepage information**
<br/>

**SSx** has an option that displays the homepage of each manifest. That makes easier to reasearch the source of the app, find details about it, etc.

<br/>

### - üåê **Backward compatible with Windows PowerShell 5.1**
<br/>

**SSx** Is compatible with the powerfull and fast Powershell Core from MS Store, or with the default Windows Powrshell included with Windows 10/11.
